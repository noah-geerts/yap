# Yap Backend

The initial backend uses TypeScript with Express and WebSockets. Tested using jest and ts-jest. No DI, no class-based services, just exported functions. Ultra simple: not even any package.json scripts.

## Quick Start

1. Ensure Node.js and npm are installed
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npx tsc` to compile the project
4. Run `node dist/index.js` to start the project
5. Run `npx jest` to test the project
